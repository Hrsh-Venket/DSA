My github repository for Monsoon 2022 1203 Data Structures and Algorithms  \
Input must be of the format:\
n                           // number of elements\
a b c d e ff g ...          // n space separated integers

As of uploading everthing to github, I have checked the logic of all of my code and understood it quite well. I do seem to have some bugs in it, though, for which I am yet to understand how to use a debugger properly. Over the next few days I will ensure all of these can run. 

Also, note: since I uploaded these after the midsem break, I am not uploading my messing around with pointers since I feel I have already sort of done this by working on many node based algorithms.
